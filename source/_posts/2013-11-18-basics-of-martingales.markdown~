Here martingale, a type of stochastic process, whose definition formalizes the concept of a fair game, is considered. 

### Martingales
A stochastic process ${Z_n,n \ge 1}$ is said to be a martingale process if 
$$ 
E[|Z_n|] < \infty \quad \text{for all n}
$$
and

$$ E[Z_{n+1} \mid Z_1,Z_2,\dots,Z_n] = Z_n. $$

Taking expectations of both sides gives

$$E[Z_{n+1}]=E[Z_n]$$

$$ E[Z_{n+1} | Z_1,Z_2,\dots,Z_n]>Z_n $$ is aaaa asldkfjasl;kj aslkdhfdsjkhgkl ajshdfkdsjhflkash
