Here martingale, a type of stochastic process, whose definition formalizes the concept of a fair game, is considered. 

### Martingales
A stochastic process ${Z_n,n \ge 1}$ is said to be a martingale process if 
$$ 
E[|Z_n|] < \infty \quad \textrf{for all n}
$$
and
$$
E[Z_n+1|Z_1,Z_2,\dots,Z_n] = Z_n
$$
